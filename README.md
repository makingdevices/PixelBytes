    Open Source projects where we struggle with engineering, electronics, coding and who knows what else... Pixel Bytes is an evolution of my previous 8-bit console. The new version is based in the STM32F103CB with IC Leds for a colorwide screen and new power to code new games.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Bytes Counter Shot][product-screenshot]](https://makingdevices.com/)

PixelBytes was born in colaboration with Wurth Elektronik and their new RGB IC LEDs. They sent me a bunch of them to test so I though of making a proper evolution of my previous video console. For this time, I wanted to test a new manufacturer for the microcontroller, so it is my first big project working with the STM32. Hopefully it will help to develop new exciting games as it is arduino-compatible. On top of that, I decided to add a giroscope sensor so we can add more ways to have fun within the gaming experience ;). 

The project is divided into two steps: 
1. The first one is the PixelBytesDisplay, which is a matrix of 13x21 IC LEDs divided in 6 strings. 
2. The second part is the host board, which will mount the microcontroller and all the battery and sensors.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Build one
The project is yet to be finished. Should you want to reproduce it, be careful. 

1. Get the gerber files for the latest version: [Pixel Bytes Display V0.1](/Gerber/Display/pixelbytesdisplay-v0.1) 
2. Get the gerber files for the latest version: [Pixel Bytes Host V0.1](/Gerber/Host/PixelBytesHostV0.1) 
3. Send them to a PCB manufacturer ([Our Sponsor is PCBWAY][sponsor-url])

YET TO BE COMPLETED.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Instructions of use:

- When turn on, a menu is shown to select between the available games.
- Once you have played a game, a score board will appear everytime you open the game.
- You have a setting menu to turn-off the init splash and the sound.
- If you leave the console one minute without touching the buttons, it will turn into sleep mode.
- Enjoy!

## Sponsors
## PCBWAY

[PCBWAY](https://www.pcbway.com/?from=makingdevices) is the most professional PCB manufacturer for prototyping and low-volume production to work with in the world. With more than a decade in the field, They are committed to meeting the needs of their customers from different industries in terms of quality, delivery, cost-effectiveness and any other demanding requests. As Sponsor of Making Devices, they will be in charge of all the PCBs for MDV, allowing both of us to grow together in a long term partnership. We hope you take them into account for your both personal and professional prototypes or products.

## WÃ¼rth Elektronik

[Wurth Elektronik](https://www.we-online.com/en) is one of the leading manufacturers of electronic and electromechanical components. The best I can say about them is to show you some pictures: All the LEDs from the board are from them. They also have buttons, resistors and capacitors that we use in all our PCBs. They also have some design kits with a lifetime refill which are amazing for makers and business so you can prototype on the go with a huge variety of components!
